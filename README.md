👋 Hi, I'm @EddyCapture
👀 I'm interested in learning NodeRed
🌱 I am currently programming a fan to turn off automatically after 1 second. The fan is switched by means of a tradfri plug.
💞️ I'm looking for a collaboration? No, learn the basic steps first. That's going well, I think.
📫 How can you reach me? I really do not know. Maybe someone else can tell me?
